These libraries are "flat" OpenVX type-compliant implementations of the core
vision functions, or "kernels". These kernels are shared between the 
"sample-c" and the "sample-c++" implementations.

c_model: flat kernels associated with language-specific kernels in sample/targets/c_model and sample-c++
debug: flat kernels associated with language-specific kernels in extensions/debug and sample-c++
