"""
This file contains the primary source table that defines the
interfaces to the node types that are supported in this implementation
of OpenVX.  It is expressed as a Python list of node descriptions.
Each node description consists of a Python 3-tuple of:

    (<node-description>, <input-list>, <output-list>)

The node description is a 4-tuple of strings:

    (<constructor>, <kernel>, <short-name>, <description>)

The constructor and kernel names should be just unadorned names; the
"vx" or "VX_KERNEL_" prefix and "Node" suffix will be added by the
code generator, so don't put them in this table.  The C header file
for defining the node constructors will be generated using the
function name "vx<constructor>Node".  The C header file defining the
kernel types will be generated with the enum value of
"VX_KERNEL_<kernel>".  The short name will be used by the GUI as-is,
and the text description will be included in all three places.  The
description can be multi-line; if so use the triple-quotes and place
the description text at the beginning of the lines with no indentation
(as is done for this comment you're reading now.)  Backslashes need to
be doubled if you want a backslash to appear in the output as per the
example below.

The input and output lists are Python lists of parameter descriptors.
Each parameter descriptor is a 3-tuple of:

    (<name>, <type>, <description>)

The "nodeTemplate" list below contains two example node descriptors
that can be used as examples.  One is a simple dummy node, and the
other is a complex node with a multi-line description.

The actual node table follows the example.  After the table is Python
code to validate the format of the node table.  After editing this
file, you should run it via the Python interpreter to make sure the
edited node table is properly formatted.

This is a fairly long multi-line textual description of a complex
node.  Comments can run on for multiple lines if they are enclosed in
triple quotes.  If any special characters are used, they still need to
be "escaped" using the backslash character.  In particular, if you
want to include an actual backslash character, e.g., for use in a
doxygen directive, you need two backslashes.  A reference to "vx_item"
needs to be written as \\ref vx_item for example.
